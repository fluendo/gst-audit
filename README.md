# Gst-Audit
Gst-Audit is a way to audit your _running_ pipeline. It provides an HTTP interface to
interact with your live pipeline.

## Installation

## Running

## Ideas

* HTTP Server to allow clients connect to a _running_ pipeline
* SSE (Server Sent Event) for notifying events (like bus messages) to the client
* HTTP REST API for manipulating the pipeline
* Attach to a running program
* Execute code natively, like property changes, etc
