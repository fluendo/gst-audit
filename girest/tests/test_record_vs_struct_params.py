"""
End-to-end tests for record vs struct inout/out parameters in GIRest.

These tests verify the proper handling of:
1. Struct out parameters (like GValue in GstIterator::next) - single pointer
2. Record/boxed out parameters (like GstMessage) - potentially double pointer for boxed types

The key difference is that:
- Structs (GI_INFO_TYPE_STRUCT) with out/inout parameters use single pointers
- Records/boxed types (registered GTypes) with out/inout parameters may use double pointers
